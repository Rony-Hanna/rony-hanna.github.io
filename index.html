    <img src="Images/ProfilePicture.jpg" class="about-img" alt="Rony Hanna Profile Picture">
    <p>
      Hello and welcome! I'm Rony Hanna, a passionate software engineer specializing in C, C++, and graphics development. Currently, I work as a C++ software engineer at Mytona in Auckland, New Zealand. I have many years of experience developing tools, rendering engines, physics simulations, and video games in C++.
      <br /><br />
      In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects like my <a href="https://github.com/EtherealPtr/Silverlight-Engine" target="_blank">C++ Vulkan rendering engine</a>.
      <br /><br />
      My favorite skill is learning. I'm always curious to learn new technologies, explore different fields, and solve complex problems. Please feel free to reach out, I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations!

        <p>
          Ravenhill is a narrative-driven detective game where players have to search for hidden objects, solve puzzles, and complete quests to unravel the city's secrets. I'm part of the feature development team where I focus on implementing new features, optimize performance for mobile platforms, and collaborate closely with artists and designers to deliver polished, player-focused experiences. My work directly supports live operations and event systems.

        <p>
          Outfire was a fast-paced online shooter game. As part of the rendering and optimization team, I worked on identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks, optimizing shaders, reducing draw calls, and improving memory management. My contributions helped improve overall frame stability and rendering efficiency.

          Hublix was a cozy, social-driven multiplayer game built in Unreal Engine, where players could meet, chat, and play in customizable social and private hubs across PC and mobile platforms. As a software engineer, I contributed to the core systems using C++ and Unreal Engine's networking system. I also developed a Python-based tooling system to improve the productivity of the design team.

        <p>
          Silverlight is a modern, high-performance rendering engine built from scratch in C++ using the Vulkan API. Driven by a deep interest in graphics engineering, I started the project from a single triangle and progressively expanded it into a modular, architecturally clean engine capable of rendering complex 3D scenes with shadows.

        <p>
          Kai's Clan is an educational platform developed in Unity that blends physical robotics with virtual environments. It enables students to import custom 3D models, control real-world robots on a physical mat, and program their behaviors using Python or Blockly.
          I implemented several core features, including real-time 3D model loading and AR/VR environments. I also collaborated with the backend and mechatronics teams to expand the robot command system and allow for more programmable robot interactions.

          Titan Voyager is a first-person shooter developed in C++ and modern OpenGL as a personal capstone project during my final university year. The goal was to apply everything I had learned in graphics programming to build a complete 3D game from scratch. 
          I implemented a custom rendering pipeline, first-person camera and control systems, cloth physics, and collision detection.
