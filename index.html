  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
	I am a software engineer with extensive experience in computer graphics and game programming. 
	Throughout my career, I have created tools, gameplay features, and user interfaces using popular 
	engines such as Unity and Unreal. I have also developed custom game engines using APIs 
	such as OpenGL and Vulkan. I enjoy participating in game jams and have showcased some of my work 
	<a href="#gamejams">here</a>. Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Mytona in New Zealand. Please take a 
	moment to view some of my <a href="#projects">projects</a> or contact me to learn more about my 
	experience and discuss any potential opportunities.
